FOR EVERY QPU EVER MADE SO THE INTERNET DOESNT BREAK   NX-bit on the processor die to disable math function to solve prime of a sha256 style encryption

WE keep classic encryption for a long time we dont go to quantum encryption
because we would have to constantly build more and more and more efficient quantum computer racing to stop a faster quantum computer from solving just a quantum function


if QUANTUM COMPUTER ON THE ENTIRE WORLD NET MUST ALWAYS USE a DISABLE_PRIME_SOLVE_FOR_ROOT_ENCRYPTION
then we keep classical computer style encryption in tact without destroying our world wide internet

since having a computer that can solve classic encryption or having to constantly race to solve a quantum encryption model it would devaste the entire world
since the entire world use classic encryption WE CAN NEVER VIOLATE OR CLASSIC computer encryption or our entire world internet would break and malfunction


EVERY QPU IN ANY DEVICE EVER BUILT MUST ALWAYS DISABLE PRIME_TO_SOLVE_ROOT_ENC for any type of encryption scheme

in the case of sha256 being a similar style for sha256 cipher resolve

prime P to find big prime P to reveal root solves prime P
^ in terms of analous math model of solving prime to reduce the cipher to reveal

SO ITS VERY SCARY BUT ANY TRANSISITOR BASED QUANTUM BASED CPU CHIP MUST ALWAYS DISABLE_THE_QUANTUM_PROCESSORS_ABILITY_AT_A_TRANSISITOR_LEVEL to run that particular type of mathematics to solve a Prime value for a reveal of an encrypted style mechanism

or literally our entire Internet would break and all of our financial systems would break


# QUANTUM-CLASSIC-ENCRYPTION-PROTECTION NX STYLE DISABLE PRIME AND BASE58

protect all classic models of encryption from prime solving root of BIG prime in all clasical
encryption functionality using hardware disable on the processor die using an NX disable bit at the QCPU function level

to never allow prime solving for detection of signature code for all classical encryption sums

(of fast prime solve for major root reveal of prime)

at the quantum cpu transisitor level similar to classic computing NX disable bit on the physical cpu level
but instead it will be an NX style disable bit for detection of primes being solved for sha256 by detecting all kernel activity of function trying to load
to stop impending reversal of all classic encryption models through transition to quantum encryption functionality
