as a possible "internet home drive" that would allow for quantum computers to operate safely without breaking the entire world wide network

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/

<p>

the "internet home drive" of 8 exa bytes would allow for quantum computers safely
because the internet home drive would be upgrade for its encryption to be quantum resistant from a quantum computer connected to it
but each internet home drive would occasionally sync with other internet home drives on the network that would also already have the information stored on the individual device as quantum resistant
this is the only safe way for quantum computers to exist
its impossible to do it the other way safely
cant have quantum computers and try to upgrade every computer invidually using it on the internet
(this is not a joke for the mentally weak that dont understand it)
because its impossible to track down through the internet every single computer that needs to upgraded for quantum resistance from quantum code breaking
but if the entire "stack" of the internet is stored in the "internet home drive" in the next 10 years
then quantum computers are safe to use the internet going through each invidiual internet home drive to be filtered for possible exploitation of encryption
because like i said if the internet home drive is released as all the information inside of it upgraded as quantum resistant
then every internet home drive per household acting as a p2p node connecting to other internet home drives "wont break the entire world wide network"

* update an alternative method 


to have protection for classical encryption mechanisms at the node level where packet distribution actually takes place
if quantum computers attempt to solve encryption functions for decrypting classic methods have node level protection if manufacturers can't agree on installing a type of "NX style disable bit" for prime root encryption functions on every QPU (Quantum Processing unit) at the hardware level


# see https://github.com/c4pt000/XORED-defense-photochain-project for ISP and cellular tower node level protection


FOR EVERY QPU EVER MADE SO THE INTERNET DOESNT BREAK   NX-bit on the processor die to disable prime math functions which allow solving prime of a sha256 style encryption

WE keep classic encryption for a long time we dont go to quantum encryption
because we would have to constantly build more and more and more efficient quantum computers racing to stop a faster quantum computer from solving just a quantum function


 QUANTUM COMPUTERS ON THE ENTIRE WORLD NET MUST ALWAYS USE a DISABLE_PRIME_SOLVE_FOR_ROOT_ENCRYPTION
then we keep classical computer style encryption in tact without destroying our world wide internet

since having a computer that can solve classic encryption or having to constantly race to solve a quantum encryption model it would devaste the entire world
since the entire world uses classic encryption WE CAN NEVER VIOLATE OR destroy CLASSIC computer encryption or our entire world internet would break and malfunction


EVERY QPU IN ANY DEVICE EVER BUILT MUST ALWAYS DISABLE PRIME_TO_SOLVE_ROOT_ENC for any type of encryption scheme

in the case of sha256 being a similar style for sha256 cipher resolve

prime P to find big prime P to reveal root solves prime P
^ in terms of analous math model of solving prime to reduce the cipher to reveal

SO ITS VERY SCARY BUT ANY TRANSISITOR BASED QUANTUM BASED CPU CHIP MUST ALWAYS DISABLE_THE_QUANTUM_PROCESSORS_ABILITY_AT_A_TRANSISITOR_LEVEL to run that particular type of mathematics to solve a Prime value for a reveal of an encrypted style mechanism

or literally our entire Internet would break and all of our financial systems would break


# QUANTUM-CLASSIC-ENCRYPTION-PROTECTION NX STYLE DISABLE PRIME 

protect all classic models of encryption from prime solving root of BIG prime in all clasical
encryption functionality using hardware disable on the processor die using an NX disable bit at the QPU function level

to never allow prime solving for detection of signature code for all classical encryption sums

(of fast prime solve for major root reveal of prime)

at the quantum cpu transisitor level similar to classic computing NX disable bit on the physical cpu level
but instead it will be an NX style disable bit for detection of primes being solved for sha256 by detecting all kernel activity of function(s) trying to load
to stop impending reversal of all classic encryption models through transition to quantum encryption functionality
