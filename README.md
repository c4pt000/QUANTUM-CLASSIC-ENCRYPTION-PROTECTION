# QUANTUM-CLASSIC-ENCRYPTION-PROTECTION

protect all classic models of encryption from prime solving root of BIG prime in all clasical
encryption functionality using hardware disable on the processor die using an NX disable bit at the QCPU function level

to never allow prime solving for detection of signature code for all classical encryption sums

(of fast prime solve for major root reveal of prime)

at the quantum cpu transisitor level similar to classic computing NX disable bit on the physical cpu level
but instead it will be an NX style disable bit for detection of primes being solved for sha256 by detecting all kernel activity of function trying to load
to stop impending reversal of all classic encryption models through transition to quantum encryption functionality 


# TO STOP REVERSAL of SSL classic style certs
# TO STOP REVERSAL of crypto style sha256 block sums past and current
# and major founding classic computing encryption functions
