# update 06-30-2024 on            OT of quantum computers operating without breaking the current known version of how our internet operates now worldwide

as a possible "internet home drive" that would allow for quantum computers to operate safely without breaking the entire world wide network

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/dna-storage/

https://www.livescience.com/technology/communications/fiber-optic-data-transfer-speeds-hit-a-rapid-301-tbps-12-million-times-faster-than-your-home-broadband-connection

<p>

the "internet home drive" of 8 exa bytes would allow for quantum computers safely
because the internet home drive would be upgraded for its encryption to be quantum resistant from a quantum computer connected to it
but each internet home drive would occasionally sync with other internet home drives on the world wide network that would also already have the information stored on the individual device as quantum resistant receiving the updates from each p2p internet drive
this is the only safe way for quantum computers to exist


its impossible to do it the other way safely....
CANT have quantum computers and try to upgrade every classic computer already in use on the world wide network for better encryption standards.....

because its impossible to track down through the internet every single classic computer using outdated encryption that is considered weak to quantum computers that needs to upgraded for quantum resistance to be protected quantum code breaking

but if the entire "stack" of the internet is stored in the "internet home drive" in the next 10 years as a home consumer device

then quantum computers are safe to use on a p2p network of internet home drives per IP going through each invidiual internet home drive to be filtered for possible exploitation of encryption before information packects are sent or received per p2p internet home drive
then every internet home drive per household acting as a p2p node connecting to other internet home drives "wont break the entire world wide network" as the information has to pass through each home device of the entire internet as a filter

so if one copy of the internet home drive was turned into a poisoned "peer" it would be rejected by the other quantum internet home drives on the world wide network

protecting the entire worlds network on an indivdual peer basis per owner

* update an alternative method 


to have protection for classical encryption mechanisms at the node level where packet distribution actually takes place
if quantum computers attempt to solve encryption functions for decrypting classic methods have node level protection if manufacturers can't agree on installing a type of "NX style disable bit" for prime root encryption functions on every QPU (Quantum Processing unit) at the hardware level


# see https://github.com/c4pt000/XORED-defense-photochain-project for ISP and cellular tower node level protection


FOR EVERY QPU EVER MADE SO THE INTERNET DOESNT BREAK   NX-bit on the processor die to disable prime math functions which allow solving prime of a sha256 style encryption

WE keep classic encryption for a long time we dont go to quantum encryption
because we would have to constantly build more and more and more efficient quantum computers racing to stop a faster quantum computer from solving just a quantum function


 QUANTUM COMPUTERS ON THE ENTIRE WORLD NET MUST ALWAYS USE a DISABLE_PRIME_SOLVE_FOR_ROOT_ENCRYPTION
then we keep classical computer style encryption in tact without destroying our world wide internet

since having a computer that can solve classic encryption or having to constantly race to solve a quantum encryption model it would devaste the entire world
since the entire world uses classic encryption WE CAN NEVER VIOLATE OR destroy CLASSIC computer encryption or our entire world internet would break and malfunction


EVERY QPU IN ANY DEVICE EVER BUILT MUST ALWAYS DISABLE PRIME_TO_SOLVE_ROOT_ENC for any type of encryption scheme

in the case of sha256 being a similar style for sha256 cipher resolve

prime P to find big prime P to reveal root solves prime P
^ in terms of analous math model of solving prime to reduce the cipher to reveal

SO ITS VERY SCARY BUT ANY TRANSISITOR BASED QUANTUM BASED CPU CHIP MUST ALWAYS DISABLE_THE_QUANTUM_PROCESSORS_ABILITY_AT_A_TRANSISITOR_LEVEL to run that particular type of mathematics to solve a Prime value for a reveal of an encrypted style mechanism

or literally our entire Internet would break and all of our financial systems would break


# QUANTUM-CLASSIC-ENCRYPTION-PROTECTION NX STYLE DISABLE PRIME 

protect all classic models of encryption from prime solving root of BIG prime in all clasical
encryption functionality using hardware disable on the processor die using an NX disable bit at the QPU function level

to never allow prime solving for detection of signature code for all classical encryption sums

(of fast prime solve for major root reveal of prime)

at the quantum cpu transisitor level similar to classic computing NX disable bit on the physical cpu level
but instead it will be an NX style disable bit for detection of primes being solved for sha256 by detecting all kernel activity of function(s) trying to load
to stop impending reversal of all classic encryption models through transition to quantum encryption functionality
